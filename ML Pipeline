Make and Export Submission File
1/ Import Packages
Write a code to only import various packages to build a classification model. Using train and test data from Kaggle. Also, we will use train test split. And we will use the classification report for performance.

2/ Import Data (train, test, sample_submission)
Read both train, test and sample_submission from this location ‘input’ folder. Into DataFrames called train, test and submission. Use pandas.

3/ Check Data
How to check data? Why to check data? Provide information in bullet points. Write code to check data.

4/ Check Target Feature
Why check the target column? How to check the target column? Check the “target” column for class imbalance . Here are the columns names in the dataset names “train”.

5&6/ Partition Data
Write a code to partition “train”, “test” data train into y, X test into X_test Use X, y to split into – X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val Exclude “target” and “enrollee_id” from X data

7/ Extract numerical and categorical feature names
Write a code to extract numerical & categorical column names from X_train. Using dtypes. Then print the list of column names.

8/ Pre-processing framework (Basic)
Write a code to perform the following: Missing Value Treatment for Numerical features using median. Use the numerical list - numerical_columns. Write in the following method. 1 - Import Package. 2 - Create an Instance. 3 - Fit Instance – X_train. 4 - Transform – X_train, X_val, X_test.

Do the same for Categorical but with constant
Do the same for numerical using StandardScaling
Do the same for categorical encoding using Ordinal Encoding
9/ Build Model and Make Predictions
Write a code to build Logistic Regression Model. Make predictions on X_train, X_val, X_test. Calculate the Classification report for X_train and X_val.

10/ Make and Export Submission File
Write a code to create a dataframe called “submission” with 2 columns “enrollee_id” and “target”. Get “enrollee_id” from test. Get “target” from a dataframe with one column “y_test_pred”. Export the same in output folder – ‘output/submission.csv’.
